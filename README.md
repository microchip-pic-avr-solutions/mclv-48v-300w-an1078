## MCLV-48V-300W dsPIC33CK256MP508 AN1078

## INTRODUCTION
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This document describes the setup requirements for running the Sensor-less FOC algorithm with a Sliding Mode Observer, which is referenced in AN1078 “Sensorless Field Oriented Control of a PMSM” and to implement three phase currents reconstruction algorithm using DC bus Current,which is referenced in AN1299“Single-Shunt Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Algorithm for
Sensorless FOC of a PMSM” using a MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board and dsPIC33CK512MP508 Motor Control Dual In-line Module (DIM).</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The demonstration is configured to run on the MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board and dsPIC33CH512MP508 Motor Control Dual In-line Module (DIM) in both Internal and External Op Amp configuration with the dsPIC33CK256MP508.
</p>

## FIELD ORIENTED CONTROL (FOC)

<p style='text-align: justify;'>In case of the PMSM, the rotor field speed must be equal to the stator (armature) field speed (i.e., synchronous). The loss of synchronization between the rotor and stator fields causes the motor to halt. Field Oriented Control (FOC) represents the method by which one of the fluxes (rotor, stator or air gap) is considered as a basis for creating a reference frame for one of the other fluxes with the purpose of decoupling the torque and flux-producing components of the stator current. The decoupling assures the ease of control for complex three-phase motors in the same manner as DC motors with separate excitation. This means the armature current is responsible for the torque generation, and the excitation current is responsible for the flux generation. In this application note, the rotor flux is considered as a reference frame for the stator and air gap flux.</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
PMSM needs accurate info about rotor flux angle (position). This can be achieved using physical sensor (encoder or resolver) or with specialized algorithm called estimators (sensorless technique). This demo code uses sliding mode observer (SMO) to estimate the rotor position. For more details, please refer to the application note "AN1078" from Microchip website.</p>

## Hadware Setup
<p style='text-align: justify;'>This section describes hardware setup required for the demonstration. Motor phase current feed-backs needed by the firmware are amplified by the operational amplifiers.</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
If the amplifiers that are internal to the dsPIC33CK256MP508 are used, then that configuration is called internal amplifier configuration. If external amplifiers are used, then that configuration is called as external amplifier configuration.</p>

1. <p style='text-align: justify;'>Perform the following modifications based upon amplifier configuration. By default, Board is configured for Internal OP-AMP Configuration.</p>


    - For running the motor in internal op amp configuration make sure that resistors R9, R29, R14 are populated and R6, R25, R10 are unpopulated on the DIM. Also ensure internal amplifiers are configured and enabled.
    - For running the motor in external amp configuration make sure that resistors R6, R25, R10  are populated and  R9, R29, R14 on the  DIM are unpopulated. Also disable internal amplifiers in the firmware.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
2. Motor currents are amplified on the MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board. The firmware and DIM are configured to sample and convert external amplifier outputs to measure the motor currents needed to implement FOC. 

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
3. Insert the dsPIC33CK256MP508 Motor Control DIM into the DIM Interface Connector J8 pro-vided on the MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board. Make sure the DIM is placed correctly and ori-ented before going ahead.</p>

<p align = "center"><font size ="2">Figure 1 DIM connected to the MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
4. Connect the three phase wires from the motor to PHA, PHB, and PHC terminals of connector J14(there is no specific order), provided on the MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board.</p>


<p align="center">

 <p align = "center"><font size="2"> Figure 2  MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board motor Connection diagram
 </p>

5.	Plug in the 24V power supply to connector J1 provided on the MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board. Alternatively, the Inverter Board can also be powered through Connector J2.

 <p align = "center"><font size="2"> Figure 3  MCLV-48V-300W Power Supply Connector
 </p>

 6.	The board has an onboard programmer ‘PICKIT™ On Board (PKOBv4)”, which can be used for programming or debugging the dsPIC33CK502MP508. To use an on-board programmer, connect a micro-USB cable between Host PC and Connector J16 provided on the MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board.

 7.	Alternatively, the device can also be programmed using the programmer/debugger (MPLAB® PICkit™ 4 In-Circuit Debugger - PG164140) by interfacing it through connector J10 of the dsPIC33CK MCLV-48V-300W Inverter Board as shown below. Ensure that the programmer is oriented correctly before proceeding..

## SOFTWARE SETUP AND RUN
### Setup: MPLAB X IDE and MPLAB XC16 Compiler
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Install MPLAB X IDE and MPLAB XC16 Compiler versions that support the device dsPIC33CK256MP508 and PKOBv4. The version of the MPLAB X IDE, MPLAB XC16 Compiler and X2C-Scope plug-in used for testing the firmware are mentioned in the section Software Tools Used for Testing the firmware. To get help on </p>

- MPLAB X IDE installation, refer [link](https://microchipdeveloper.com/mplabx:installation)
- MPLAB XC16 Compiler installation steps, refer [link](https://microchipdeveloper.com/xc16:installation)

<p style='text-align: justify;'>If MPLAB IDE v8 or earlier is already installed on your computer, then run the MPLAB driver switcher (It is installed when MPLAB®X IDE is installed) to switch from MPLAB IDE v8 drivers to MPLAB X IDE drivers. If you have Windows 7 or 8, you must run MPLAB driver switcher in ‘Administrator Mode’. To run the Device Driver Switcher GUI application as administrator, right click on the executable (or desktop icon) and select ‘Run as Administrator’. For additional details refer MPLAB X IDE help topic “Before You Begin: Install the USB Device Drivers (For Hardware Tools): USB Driver Installation for Windows Operating Systems”. </p>

### Setup: X2C - SCOPE
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
X2C - SCOPE is a MPLAB X IDE plugin that allows a developer to interact with an application while the application program is running. X2C-Scope enables you to read, write, and plot global variables (for motor control) in real time. It communicates with the target using the UART. To use X2C, the plugin must be installed:</p>

- In MPLAB X IDE, select Tools>Plugins and click on the Available Plugins tab.

##  BASIC DEMONSTRATION
### Firmware Description
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This firmware is implemented to work on Microchip’s 16-bit Digital signal controller (dsPIC® DSC) dsPIC33CK256MP508. 
For more information, see the dsPIC33CK256MP508 Family datasheet (DS70005349).</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The Motor Control Demo application uses push button to start or stop the motor and poten-tiometer to vary speed of the motor.</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This Motor Control Demo Application configures and uses peripherals like PWM, ADC, UART etc. required for implementing Sensor-less Field Oriented Control (FOC) of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) based on the motor control application AN1299 & AN1078.</p>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
